# tmm-support
A Support &amp; Ticketing Solution For Teams Using WooCommerce

This plugin should work fine with any theme.  It uses Gravity Forms for the front-end ticket submission, but you could use whatever email form plugin you prefer.  The posts show up on the WooCommerce "My Account" page, which by default can be found at http://yoursite.com/my-account

To-do List:

* Add a Client ID field to the WP User profile, then filter the tickets by that id, so they'll never see a different client's tickets.
* Include Gravity Forms import file
* Add better instructions to Readme file.  For example, include instructions on setting up GF with the Advanced Post addon.
* Make pagination prettier.
* Make it so when they click "Active" or "Closed" taxonomy, it only shows their tickets.
* Display "Active" tickets first.
