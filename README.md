A Support &amp; Ticketing Solution For Teams Using WooCommerce

This plugin should work fine with any theme.  It uses Gravity Forms for the front-end ticket submission, but you could use whatever email form plugin you prefer.  The posts show up on the WooCommerce "My Account" page, which by default can be found at http://yoursite.com/my-account  

See the screenshot in this repo for more info.
